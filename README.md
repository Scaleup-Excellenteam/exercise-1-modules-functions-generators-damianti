# exercise-1-modules-functions-generators-damianti

In this exercise we are doing some simple functions using modules.

In the first function, given a URL, the function returns all the files with prefix "deep"

In the second function, given two dates, the program returns a date between both dates and prints "I have no vinagrette!" if that day is Monday
